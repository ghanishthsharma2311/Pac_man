# Pac-Man Game - Build Instructions

## How to Build and Run
Follow these simple commands to build and play the game:

1.  **Prepare the project**:
    ```bash
    ./prepare.sh
    ```
    This generates the necessary configuration files (Makefile, etc.) and sets up a `build/` folder for temporary files to keep your directory clean.

2.  **Compile**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This compiles the source code.

3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./Pac_man1
    ```
    (Note: The executable name defaults to the folder name)

## Notes
- The `prepare.sh` script runs `qmake` to generate the connection between your C++ files and the Qt library.
- `.qmake.stash` is a temporary cache file created by `qmake`. You can ignore it.
- `Makefile` is the recipe for the compiler, generated by `prepare.sh`.
